A high spray rate may cause coating defects such as twinning, picking and sticking and logo bridging. A low spray rate may cause spray drying and a loss in coating efficiency.");}

The administration of drugs via oral dosage forms is one of the most common and effective means of delivering treatments to patients. When a dosage form is swallowed, the rate at which it releases the active ingredient is critical to ensure that the drug is delivered properly. The rate at which the drug is released is called the dissolution rate.");}
